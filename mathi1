What should they continue doing?

Mathi should continue her structured and goal-oriented way of working. She consistently demonstrates a strong focus on timelines and is able to deliver even under challenging conditions, such as the complexities of release cycles during the data migration project. Her ability to remain calm under pressure, to always act with a clear plan, and to align her team on priorities is one of her greatest strengths.

In addition, Mathi’s communication style should definitely be continued. The regular 1:1 calls she set up were not only helpful in clarifying progress and expectations but also created a sense of transparency and trust across different teams. This ensured that everyone was aligned and confident in the project’s direction.

Another area she should continue is her proactive attitude. Beyond successfully leading the development of the “New Carmen” application to enable archival of Credit Suisse data into Lazar, she took the initiative to address issues in the legacy Carmen application. By stepping in, categorizing incidents, and leading efforts to reduce the backlog, she helped the L2 team improve production stability. Her proactive leadership in that area, although outside the original scope, brought tangible results week by week.

Overall, Mathi should continue combining structured planning, strong execution, and transparent communication, as this mix makes her highly effective and reliable.

What could they do to have more impact?

Mathi could have an even greater impact by sharing her structured approach more broadly across crews. Her way of planning, creating clarity in communication, and ensuring follow-up on actions could serve as an excellent model for others. Sharing best practices from the migration project and from her backlog reduction work on the legacy application would provide valuable guidance to teams facing similar challenges.

Additionally, she could increase her visibility by taking part in cross-crew forums or knowledge-sharing sessions, where her experience in balancing delivery pressure with systematic planning could inspire other leaders. This would not only help others benefit from her methods but also strengthen cross-team collaboration and efficiency at a larger scale.

She could also have more impact by delegating certain aspects of incident or backlog management to upcoming team members, thereby fostering development opportunities for others while maintaining her oversight. This would multiply her influence while continuing to ensure quality outcomes.

Any other feedback?

Working with Mathi has been a very positive experience. She demonstrates reliability, accountability, and a solution-oriented mindset in every interaction. Her ability to keep focus on the larger program goals while at the same time taking ownership of additional challenges (such as stabilizing the legacy Carmen platform) shows strong leadership and commitment.

She is highly structured, always comes with a plan, and communicates clearly about the steps forward. This creates alignment and trust not only within her own crew but also with peers in other areas. Her contributions had a direct impact on the success of the Credit Suisse archival migration program, which was both highly visible and highly complex.

Overall, Mathi stands out as a dependable and proactive leader who can be counted on to deliver results while strengthening collaboration and team spirit.
