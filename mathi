What should they continue doing?

Mathi should continue her strong focus on timely delivery and results. She managed to complete a highly complex project under tight deadlines while keeping collaboration open and transparent. Her 1:1 communication style created clarity and trust across teams. Additionally, her proactive support for the legacy Carmen application and leadership in reducing the incident backlog showed real ownership and reliability. These qualities should definitely be continued.

What could they do to have more impact?

Mathi could increase her impact by sharing more best practices and lessons learned from leading large-scale migration and incident management efforts. This would help other teams facing similar challenges and amplify the value she already brings. She might also expand her visibility by taking a more active role in cross-crew forums, where her experience and structured approach could inspire broader adoption of effective practices.
