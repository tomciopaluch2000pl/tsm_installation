Mathi should continue her structured and goal-oriented approach to project delivery. She successfully led the development of “New Carmen” to enable the archival of Credit Suisse data into Lazar, keeping the project on track despite multiple release challenges. Her strong focus on deadlines, combined with clear and consistent communication (including regular 1:1 calls), created alignment and transparency across teams.

She should also continue showing proactive ownership beyond her original scope. By taking initiative to support the legacy Carmen application, categorizing incidents, and guiding the L2 team in systematically reducing the backlog, she demonstrated reliability and a strong sense of accountability. These behaviors directly strengthened operational stability while maintaining progress on the main program goals.

What could they do to have more impact?

Mathi could broaden her impact by sharing her structured planning methods and incident management practices more widely across crews. Her way of combining focus, discipline, and transparency could serve as a valuable model for others. Taking part in more cross-crew forums, knowledge-sharing sessions, or even mentoring would help extend her influence beyond her immediate team.

Additionally, Mathi could consider gradually delegating some of the detailed backlog/incident activities to team members, while she focuses more on strategic oversight. This would both support the development of others and give her space to concentrate on the broader program challenges where her leadership brings the most value.

Any other feedback?

Working with Mathi has been a very positive experience. She is reliable, well-prepared, and always communicates with clarity. Her ability to deliver results while maintaining a collaborative and supportive style is a strength that benefits both her crew and peers in other areas.

At the same time, what stands out is her balance: she not only keeps focus on key objectives but also steps in when operational stability is at risk, ensuring no important aspect is left unattended. With slightly more visibility and knowledge-sharing across crews, Mathi could increase her already strong contribution even further.
